# Actions

- Create specific, well-named actions rather than generic ones
- Put all business logic inside action definitions
- Use hooks like `Ash.Changeset.after_action/2`, `Ash.Changeset.before_action/2` to add additional logic
  inside the same transaction.
- Use hooks like `Ash.Changeset.after_transaction/2`, `Ash.Changeset.before_transaction/2` to add additional logic
  outside the transaction.
- Use action arguments for inputs that need validation
- Use preparations to modify queries before execution
- Preparations support `where` clauses for conditional execution
- Use `only_when_valid?` to skip preparations when the query is invalid
- Use changes to modify changesets before execution
- Use validations to validate changesets before execution
- Prefer domain code interfaces to call actions instead of directly building queries/changesets and calling functions in the `Ash` module
- A resource could be *only generic actions*. This can be useful when you are using a resource only to model behavior.

## Action Types

- **Read**: For retrieving records
- **Create**: For creating records
- **Update**: For changing records
- **Destroy**: For removing records
- **Generic**: For custom operations that don't fit the other types

## Error Handling

Functions to call actions, like `Ash.create` and code interfaces like `MyApp.Accounts.register_user` all return ok/error tuples. All have `!` variations, like `Ash.create!` and `MyApp.Accounts.register_user!`. Use the `!` variations when you want to "let it crash", like if looking something up that should definitely exist, or calling an action that should always succeed. Always prefer the raising `!` variation over something like `{:ok, user} = MyApp.Accounts.register_user(...)`.

All Ash code returns errors in the form of `{:error, error_class}`. Ash categorizes errors into four main classes:

1. **Forbidden** (`Ash.Error.Forbidden`) - Occurs when a user attempts an action they don't have permission to perform
2. **Invalid** (`Ash.Error.Invalid`) - Occurs when input data doesn't meet validation requirements
3. **Framework** (`Ash.Error.Framework`) - Occurs when there's an issue with how Ash is being used
4. **Unknown** (`Ash.Error.Unknown`) - Occurs for unexpected errors that don't fit the other categories

These error classes help you catch and handle errors at an appropriate level of granularity. An error class will always be the "worst" (highest in the above list) error class from above. Each error class can contain multiple underlying errors, accessible via the `errors` field on the exception.

## Custom Modules vs. Anonymous Functions

Prefer to put code in its own module and refer to that in changes, preparations, validations etc.

For example, prefer this:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.MyDomain.MyResource.Changes.SlugifyName do
  use Ash.Resource.Change

  def change(changeset, _, _) do
    Ash.Changeset.before_action(changeset, fn changeset, _ ->
      slug = MyApp.Slug.get()
      Ash.Changeset.force_change_attribute(changeset, :slug, slug)
    end)
  end
end

change MyApp.MyDomain.MyResource.Changes.SlugifyName
```
