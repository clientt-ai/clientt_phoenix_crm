# Ash Framework Basics

## Understanding Ash

Ash is an opinionated, composable framework for building applications in Elixir. It provides a declarative approach to modeling your domain with resources at the center. Read documentation *before* attempting to use its features. Do not assume that you have prior knowledge of the framework or its conventions.

## Code Structure & Organization

- Organize code around domains and resources
- Each resource should be focused and well-named
- Create domain-specific actions rather than generic CRUD operations
- Put business logic inside actions rather than in external modules
- Use resources to model your domain entities

## Data Layers

Data layers determine how resources are stored and retrieved. Examples of data layers:

- **Postgres**: For storing resources in PostgreSQL (via `AshPostgres`)
- **ETS**: For in-memory storage (`Ash.DataLayer.Ets`)
- **Mnesia**: For distributed storage (`Ash.DataLayer.Mnesia`)
- **Embedded**: For resources embedded in other resources (`data_layer: :embedded`) (typically JSON under the hood)
- **Ash.DataLayer.Simple**: For resources that aren't persisted at all. Leave off the data layer, as this is the default.

Specify a data layer when defining a resource:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Post do
  use Ash.Resource,
    domain: MyApp.Blog,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer

  postgres do
    table "posts"
    repo MyApp.Repo
  end

  # ... attributes, relationships, etc.
end
```

For embedded resources:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Address do
  use Ash.Resource,
    data_layer: :embedded

  attributes do
    attribute :street, :string
    attribute :city, :string
    attribute :state, :string
    attribute :zip, :string
  end
end
```

Each data layer has its own configuration options and capabilities. Refer to the rules & documentation of the specific data layer package for more details.

## Generating Code

Use `mix ash.gen.*` tasks as a basis for code generation when possible. Check the task docs with `mix help <task>`.
Be sure to use `--yes` to bypass confirmation prompts. Use `--yes --dry-run` to preview the changes.

## Migrations and Schema Changes

After creating or modifying Ash code, run `mix ash.codegen <short_name_describing_changes>` to ensure any required additional changes are made (like migrations are generated). The name of the migration should be lower_snake_case. In a longer running dev session it's usually better to use `mix ash.codegen --dev` as you go and at the end run the final codegen with a sensible name describing all the changes made in the session.
